On September 6, 2024, at approximately 9:10 p.m., troopers responded to a crash involving a Nissan Sentra and a Jeep Grand Cherokee on Seaford Road near Camp Road in Laurel. Before troopers arrived, they were told that the driver of the Nissan was trying to leave the scene. When troopers arrived, they contacted the driver of the Nissan, identified as Darnell Strand. He showed signs of impairment and refused Standardized Field Sobriety Tests. When troopers tried to arrest Strand, he resisted by pulling away but was ultimately taken into custody. During a search of Strand, troopers found approximately 25 grams of marijuana. During a search of the Nissan, they found a scale and a loaded handgun. A computer check showed that Strand had two previous DUI-related convictions and is prohibited from possessing a firearm. The driver and passenger in the Jeep were not injured.    Strand was taken to Troop 5 where he was charged with the crimes listed below, arraigned by Justice of the Peace Court 3, and committed to Sussex Correctional Institution on a $9,506 cash bond.
