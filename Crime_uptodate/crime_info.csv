Assault,09/15/2024 6:15 AM,"Assault. Officers were dispatched to a shooting where the victim was struck by gunfire that came through the wall of their apartment while they were asleep, causing non-life threatening injuries. Upon arrival, officers determined that multiple shots were fired from within an adjoining apartment, which officers found unoccupied.While attempting to locate the tenant of that apartment, officers heard gunfire in the area. Officers later learned that the suspect drove to the KeyBank (27 Spectrum Lp.) where he discharged his firearm into the business.While still checking the area to investigate the shots they heard, officers were notified of and dispatched to another incident at Village Inn (7384 Duryea Dr.) where the suspect had fired shots into the Village Inn and was attempting to gain entry. A short time later, additional gunfire was reported at another KeyBank - 3506 Hartsel Road.The suspect then returned to the Nahcolite Pt. address where he was contacted by officers and taken into custody. A Reverse-911 community notification to Shelter-in-Place was initiated before the suspect was located but it has since been rescinded.","11300 BLOCK OF NAHCOLITE PT, Colorado Springs, CO",39.00267479271686,-104.81053147510003
